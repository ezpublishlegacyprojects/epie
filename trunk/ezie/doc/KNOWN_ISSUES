KNOWN ISSUES on EZIE
====================

Black & White filter applied to a region
----------------------------------------

The black & white filter won't apply to a specific region but to the whole document. The reason hasn't been found in the
ezie code itself, and might require investigation in the conversion ezcomponent.

Contrast and pixelate don't support the region limitaton with GD
----------------------------------------------------------------

This hasn't been implemented in the first place, and is a bit more complex than with ImageMagick

Default eZ Publish image.ini settings will make ezcImageConverter fail
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The default ezp image.ini contains ImageMagick.Executable = 'convert' and ImageMagick.ExecutablePath = ''. This is an issue with the current code, as we use this configuration for the component, and end up with a binary named convert. If a custom binary setting is sent to the component, it won't look in the path, and will therefore throw an exception since it won't find a file by that name in the current directory.
