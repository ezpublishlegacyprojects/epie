FIX
===
* The brightness filter doesn't respect the selected region
  * Fixed with imagemagick, not on GD
* The contrast filter doesn't respect the selected region
  * Fixed with imagemagick, not on GD
* Commit the cluster index changes to ezp svn so that the editor works with clustering
* Change the ezie images path so that it works with the default ezp rewrite rules

VERIFY
======
* Check what exact ezp version ezie requires
* Check if the following actions do support a region:
  * contrast:    OK on ImageMagick, still broken on GD
  * brightness   OK on ImageMagick, still broken on GD
  * pixelate:    OK
  * sepia:       OK
  * black white: KO just doesn't work. Dunno why yet, need to dig in the component
