FIX
===
* Make eZIEezcImageConverter use the eZ Publish image advanced settings (path to image magick, etc)
* The brightness filter doesn't respect the selected region
* The contrast filter doesn't respect the selected region

VERIFY
======
* Check how watermark files can be added
* Check what exact ezp version ezie requires
* Check if the following actions do support a region:
  * contrast:   KO
  * brightness  KO
  * pixelate:   OK
  * sepia:      OK
